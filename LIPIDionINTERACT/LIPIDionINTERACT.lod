\contentsline {todos}{{32. }The discussion about simulation results with CaCl$_2$ to be written once we have all the results.}{3}{}
\contentsline {todos}{{34. }The discussion should be finished when we have CHARMM results with CaCl$_2$.}{4}{}
\contentsline {todos}{{35. }The $^1$H NMR experiments suggest that the N-$\beta $-$\alpha $-O dihedral is only in gaughe conformation in the absense of ions, but in the presense of multivalent ions there would be also anti conformations present [Hauser et al. BBA {\bf 508}, 450 (1978), Hauser et al. Chem. Phys. Lipids {\bf 29}, 103 (1981)]. I think that we should check if this happens in simulations.}{4}{}
\contentsline {todos}{{36. }In the Orange simulation only lipid model is changed, respect to Berger, and Jukka tested the effect of 0.7 charge scaling for Na ion (suggested by Leontyev et al.\nobreakspace {}\cite {leontyev11} to compensate to the lack of electronic polarizability in the model). I think we should discuss these things in supplementary material. Even though we cannot be fully conclusive, there is some essential information also in these results.}{4}{}
\contentsline {todos}{{29. }I have already Orange simulations running with 1M and 140mM NaCl concentrations. I think I should still run CHARMM36 with 1M and maybe with close to 150mM. Some of the simulations had accidentally over 1M concentration and those are not useful for this plot.}{5}{}
\contentsline {todos}{{30. }I think that we have to run CHARMM36 with CaCl$_2$. If anyone happen to have the data and is willing to share, let us know. If not, then I will do it.}{5}{}
\contentsline {todos}{{31. } I think that it would be very interesting to test the modified CHARMM ions: Venable et al. dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp401512z, J. Phys. Chem. B 2013, 117, 10183−10192. According to the paper, these parameters improve the ion binding to the charged lipid bilayers. Even though I think that testing this would be highly relevant, I do not have time to do it now.}{5}{}

\contentsline {todos}{{33. }This figure is in progress, however, the main point can be seen. \\ - I think that we should use number densities instead of mass densities to make the difference between Na and Ca distributions more clear. Now the difference comparison is little bit distracted due to the different mass of the atoms. \\ - The lipid density from MacRog simulation is missing. Maybe Matti Javanainen could provide this? If the data will be uploaded to Zenodo, it also trivial to calculate it with script. \\ - CONCENTRATION CALCULATION ISSUE FIXED, SEE http://nmrlipids.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-first-draft-of-ion-lipid.html?showComment=1423750867868\#c3435589938183508901. \\ The systems are here now with quite different concentrations so comparison is not straigthforward. One option would be to run simulations of all systems with 150mM which would be close to physiological concentrations, and show the density distributions from those here. \\ - I think that CHARMM36 simulation with CaCl$_2$ should be done \\ - Figure editing will be finished (centering of the graphs, labels, etc.) will be done once the above issues have been sorted out. }{8}{}
