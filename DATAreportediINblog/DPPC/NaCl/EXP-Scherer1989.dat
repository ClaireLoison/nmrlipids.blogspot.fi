# DPPC. 318K. 2H-NMR. [NaCl] = 150 mM.
#
# The g2 order parameter S_CD given here is calculated using
#
#    S_CD =  Δν * 4/(3*170 kHz),
#
# where Δν = 26.1 kHz is the reported quadrupolar splitting.
#
# Note that the sample in question was "1,2-dipalmitoyl-rac-
# glycero-3-phosphocholine deeuterated at the C-2 position
# of the glycerol backbone (GC-2-DPPC)", that is, mixture of
# DPPCs containing either left- or right-handed glycerols.
# Importantly, though, this sample gave "just one quadrupole
# splitting of 26.1 kHz", that is, the S_CD value of g_2 does
# not depend on the isomerization.
#
# Note also, that in Table II of the publication, when
# referring to this datum, the authors write "E. Leung, H.
# Hauser, and J. Seelig (unpublished results)". As far
# as known, this publication has never appeared.
#
# The funny 2-row format is to allow drawing horizontal lines
# in gnuplot.
