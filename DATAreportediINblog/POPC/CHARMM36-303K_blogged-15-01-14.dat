# POPC. 303K.

# 128 lipids, no ions, ~40 H2O molecules/lipid, TIPS3P.

# CHARMM36. Force field files downloaded from:

#    http://www.gromacs.org/@api/deki/files/184/=charmm36.ff_4.5.4_ref.tgz,
#
# i.e., they are those of Piggot et al., 2012, JCTC. Starting structures from:

#
# After equilibration, 150 ns simulations. The first 50ns was discarded for the
# order parameter calculation. Area per lipid and order parameter of the acyl
# chains were the same as reported by Piggot et al.
